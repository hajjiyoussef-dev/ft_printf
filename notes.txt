==> GET_NEXT_LINE ==>

 -> get_next_line project is an important one, as it teaches file reading and memory management

 ------------------------------------------------
==> a few key steps: ==> 

1. Understand the Goal
   .You need to write a function that reads a file line by line, even if the file has no newline characters.
   .The function must work efficiently, even for very large files.

2. Key Concepts
   .Static Variables: These help you retain data between function calls.
   .Buffer Management: You’ll need to handle partial reads and join buffers correctly.
   .Dynamic Memory: Allocating, freeing, and avoiding leaks is critical.

3. Helper Functions
   .Since you’re already using ft_strlen, ft_strjoin, ft_strdup, ft_strchr,  focus on leveraging them efficiently to:
   .Handle buffer manipulations.
   .Search for newline characters.
   .Manage strings properly.

4. Start Small
   .Begin with just reading the file in chunks.
   .Then build logic to split lines from the buffer.
   .Finally, handle edge cases like EOF and empty lines.
